This field is just needed if you want to import contents from your LMS.</p><p>If later you sign in into %s from an LMS this field will be filled automatically.</p>"

msgid "help-lti-use"

msgid "help-activities-title"
msgstr "What are Activities?"

msgid "help-activities-desc-1"
msgstr "Actvities can be seen as the challenges you can create for your students in your games. For now an activity can be either a <b>question</b> or a <b>group of questions</b>. The main difference between them is just that by using a group of questions in a game, instead of a question, a random question from this group will be chosen to be presented to the players."

msgid "help-activities-desc-2"
msgstr "In this area you can manage those kind of activities by creating, editing, or deleting them. If you prefer you can also import your activities from a LMS. Either way, you can then associate hints and resources to questions. Hints can be used in your games for the <b>Request Hints</b> help and resources for the <b>Consult Learning Materials</b> help."

msgid "help-games-title"
msgstr "What are Games?"

In the project you define the game scenarios and their rules and design. After that you can export a project as a game and it will appear on your Games Section in the Dashboard."

msgid "help-projects-desc-2"
msgstr "In this section you can manage all your projects by creating, editing, or deleting them. You can also open them to make changes or improvements. Besides those options, you can also choose to export them as a game, which will create a new game available on your Games Section in the Dashboard."

msgid "help-resources-title"
msgstr "What are Resources?"

msgid "help-resources-desc-1"
msgstr "Resources are files: more precisely, <b>audio</b>, <b>image</b>, <b>video</b>, or <b>PDF</b> files. Those files can be used in your games to display concepts to players, or as design elements. For example, you can use a audio resource as background music, or as a way to present a concept to players. A resource can be either a file you provide or a file from a URL you found on the Web (for videos you can also use Youtube or Vimeo links)."

msgid "help-resources-desc-2"
msgstr "In this area you can manage those kind of resources by creating, editing, or deleting them. If you prefer you can also import them from a LMS.

msgid "help-scenarios-title"
msgstr "What are Scenarios?"

msgid "help-scenarios-desc-1"
msgstr "A <b>scenario</b> is a game screen. Think of it as a slide in a presentation, where each slide usually contains text and images, and in some cases animations and other multimedia content. Here scenarios are very similar to the slide concept, but on this case they are interactive, so besides text and multimedia contents you can also add activities to them. The kind of text used must also be different, since we are talking about a game and not a lecture in a classroom."

msgid "help-lecture-scenarios-title"
msgstr "What are Lecture Scenarios?"

msgid "help-lecture-scenarios-desc"
msgstr "A lecture scenario can contain texts, shapes and resources. You can use it to present a concept or topic to players. This type of scenario allows two types of jumps: continue to next scenario (button), and a time limit to learn the concept"

msgid "help-activities-scenarios-title"
msgstr "What are Activities Scenarios?"

msgid "help-activities-scenarios-desc"
msgstr "An activities scenario can contain texts, shapes, resources and activities. You can use it mainly to create challenges for your students. This type of scenario allows you to set a limit for the number of helps players can use, and several bonus types based on the activities presented. Besides that, it also allows three types of jumps: skip from scenario (button), all players finished activities, and a time limit to finish."

msgid "help-template-scenarios-title"
msgstr "What is a Scenario Template?"

msgid "help-template-scenarios-desc"
msgstr "A scenario template is a lecture or activities scenario with several elements already defined and positioned so you just need to fill them."

msgid "help-sessions-title"
msgstr "What are sessions logs?"

msgid "help-sessions-desc-1"
msgstr "Sessions logs are the generated logs for each finished game session. A game session is created each time a player starts a game and it can contain one or more players that are playing with each other. Players that cannot interact are on different sessions. The generated logs contain only the information you chose to log while creating the game, which can be used for students assessment. To consult them use the chart button on the game profile page, or on the right side in the Dashboard."
